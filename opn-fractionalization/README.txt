i have huggingface integrated and it will generate images. 
yarn for node modules and yarn dev to start up.
if you want to deploy contracts on SAGE network, that are in the opn-contracts/contracts folder, both were already deployed on the first opn testnet so maybe go through them quickly to make sure its all good because its been a while.
once deployed, the app needs to be integrated for SAGE network.
User flow,
1. landing page
2. go to marketplace and connect wallet
3. create asset to tokenize
        generate images (holds up to 5)
        name it and give it a description 
        input share / token amounts
        overview
        complete

there is a profanity filter put in as well with a 3 chance lockout warning pop up with a 24hr lockout for the forth violation on wallet address and IP address.
once contracts are deployed and frontend has sage integrated, you should be able to create (which pictures should upload to ipfs already) and should be able to buy and sell. 
it was all working when deployed 4 months ago but you never know, things change haha. play around and have fun. dont worry about screwing anything up as i have a full copy of this project.
